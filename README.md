# py_chat
A simple chat utility to communicate between computers in a local network

To use one of the computer can act as the server by starting the server.py on it.

To connect to the server, use the client.py file.

Steps to connect:
1) When you start the client.py file, it will open a console which will look like this:
Enter host:
Enter port:

Here, host is the IP adress of the server ,i.e., the computer in which the server.py file is running. The port is 33000.

After entering the details, a windows will come up which will tell you to enter your name. After providing the details. you will be connected to the chat.

This chat application does not support chat history, i.e, the moment the server is closed , all the chats will be lost. Hence will enhance privacy of the communication. Also, the port number acts as a pin which allows only the required members to join the chat.

This is only a barebone script .I am Working on making it more user friendly.
