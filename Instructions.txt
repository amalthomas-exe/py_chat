Steps to use:
1) One of the computers can act as the server by running the server.py file.

2) You can connect to the server using the client.py file. When you run the file, it will launch a console window    which looks like:
   Enter host:
   Enter port:
   
   Here, host is the IP (orIPv4/IPv6) address of the computer in which the server.py file is running. The port, by   
   default is 33000. but you can change it by editing the server.py at line no. 48:
   PORT = <your preferred port number>

3) Once you have entered the required info, a window will popup which will ask for your name.

4) Once you enter your name and press Enter, you would have joined the chat.
